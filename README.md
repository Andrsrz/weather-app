# Weather App
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - [Project Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

## Getting Started
Search for any weather in the world. Just input the city name and the units you
want to use and you'll have right back!

## What have I learned?
* Setup a Vue project with [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
* [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
* Using API's
  * [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current)
  * [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

## Know Issues
Right now I couldn't test properly the Geolocation option because it keeps
returning me that "Location information is unavailable".
